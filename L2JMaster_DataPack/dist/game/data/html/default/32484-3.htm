Rim Kamaloka is the latest means by which the Darkness Strikes at us -- this time, through our very dreams. Unless you whitstand the attack, you will die in your sleep.<br>
Our Sages have determined that the best defense is to enter that place and mount a preemptive attack. If you have the courage, it is possible to challenge Rim Kamaloka and survive.<br>
