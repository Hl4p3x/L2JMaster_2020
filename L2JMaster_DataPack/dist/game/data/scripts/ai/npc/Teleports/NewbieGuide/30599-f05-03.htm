In the beginning, try capturing <font color="LEVEL">red keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">gray wolves</font> near the village. But be careful! The gray wolves can cause problems for inexperienced or incautious adventurers.<br>
Once you have passed level 6, leave the village using the southwest or southeast entrances and challenge the <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orc Tribe</font>. Remember, though, that if Orcs see another of their race being attacked, they will join in the fight.<br>
When you target a monster, that monster's name will appear on the top center part of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the monster's name indicates that monster's strength.</font> To start, you should only fight monsters whose names are white or sky-blue. Monsters whose names appear in orange or red are stronger than you, so don't attack them recklessly.<br>
Also, hunt near the <font color="LEVEL">Shadow of the Mother Tree</font> as much as possible. If you go beneath the Shadow of the Mother Tree, you will be healed quickly.<br>
