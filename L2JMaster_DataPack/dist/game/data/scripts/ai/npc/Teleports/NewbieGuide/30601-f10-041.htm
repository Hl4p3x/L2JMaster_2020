<font color="LEVEL">Create Item</font> is one of a Dwarf's mainstays. This passive skill makes it possible for you to <font color="LEVEL">Create Items</font>. Since those items have levels, you must raise this skill level in order to create higher-level items.<br>
To create an item, first obtain a <font color="LEVEL">Recipe</font>. Simply stated, a recipe is a blueprint that tells you how to create an item. Great artisans will only share their item creation methods with those who possess sufficient talent and experience, which is why they intentionally entrust their item recipes to strong monsters. In order to create a better item, you must capture a stronger monster and obtain the recipe from that monster. <br>
The recipe contains the information necessary for creating the item, including: Create Item skill level, ingredients, tools and method. A simple item can be created after collecting all the ingredients, but to create complicated items, you may first have to embark on a dangerous adventure. <br>
Why don't you go capture some monsters and obtain a recipe? Once you've seen what one looks like, you'll better understand the process.<br>
