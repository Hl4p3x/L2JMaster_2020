<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Now you should learn about Kamael weapons. A Kamael who completes the first class transfer can learn how to customize other races' weapons to Kamael ones. With that skill, a Kamael can change <font color="LEVEL">a One-Handed Sword to a Short Sword, a Two-Handed Sword into a Steel Sword and a Bow into a Crossbow</font>.<br>
Just make sure that you have at least a D-grade weapon. Choose one that best matches the situation.<br>
At your level, you can use a Sword or a Blunt weapon. Besides, you can save money buying a <font color="LEVEL">Long Sword</font>. Sometimes you can buy a <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Reflection</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Watershadow</font> at the same price, but their function is almost the same as a Long Sword.<br>
If you prefer to use a Short Sword, try to equip yourself with a <font color="LEVEL">Shining Knife</font>. <br>
If you are using a Bow as a support weapon, you do not have to buy a Forest Bow -- a <font color="LEVEL">Hunting Bow</font> should be good enough for your purposes.<br>
Regarding armor, start with a <font color="LEVEL">Bone Breastplate and Bone Gaiters</font>, along with a Buckler, Gloves, Leather Shoes and a Wooden Helmet, all of which make an effective combination once you reach level 17. However, there are many items that have slightly different properties but are available at similar prices, so pay close attention to the items being sold and bought by others. <br>
