<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
The hunting area I recommend for warriors at your level is the <font color="LEVEL">Hills of Gold</font>, located south of the village. If you choose to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Muertos Guards, Muertos Scouts, Muertos Warriors or Colossuses</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hills of Gold</font>, however, you would be advised to first advance a level.<br>
Once you are fully comfortable in battle, you might also wish to hunt in <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Cave</font>, located far north of the village. Take great care when hunting at Nornil's Cave, though! You may confidently hunt <font color="LEVEL">Grotto Golems</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Shady Muertos Guards</font> at your current level, but the other monsters there will be beyond your current skill.<br>
