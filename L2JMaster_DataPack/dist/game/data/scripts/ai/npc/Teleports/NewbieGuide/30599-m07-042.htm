You may begin to learn spells at level 7. I recommend that you begin by learning the <font color="LEVEL">Wind Strike spell to level 2</font>. If you have enough SP, you should raise it all the way to level 3.<br>
If Wind Stike doesn't suit you for some reason, consider <font color="LEVEL">level 1 Ice Bolt.</font> This spell will slow the movement rate of the target, and can be a great aid to successful hunting.<br>
