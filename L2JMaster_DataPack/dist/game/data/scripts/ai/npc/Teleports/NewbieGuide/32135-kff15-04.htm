True, there are no new skills to learn at this level. But strengthening the skills you already possess is also important.<br>
Have you used attack skills like <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Attack</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Arrow</font>? As you know, when you use Fallen Attack while equipped with a dagger or blunt weapon, you can strike a fatal blow to your enemy. Fallen Arrow is useful when you attack enemies with a bow. Both of these skills can become even more powerful with use, so raise your skill levels by using SP for hunting. Of course, it is also natural for you to want to improve SP by improving <font color="LEVEL">Soul Mastery</font>.<br>
To increase your offensive and defensive power, distribute SP to the passive skills related to other masteries and raise your skill level. <br>
