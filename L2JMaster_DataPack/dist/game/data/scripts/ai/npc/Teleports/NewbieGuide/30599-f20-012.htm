In order to advance to an Elven Scout or Knight, you must be <font color="LEVEL">level 20 or above</font> and pass each test.<br>
But even so, we do not advance you here. You must leave the Elven Forest and go to the Human Kingdom. The closest region is called <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>, located south of the Elven Forest.<br>
