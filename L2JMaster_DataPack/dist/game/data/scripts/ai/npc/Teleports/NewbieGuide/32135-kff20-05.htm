<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
If you want to travel the world, go to <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Kekropus</font>. He knows a hidden truth about our race, which I have heard that he will only reveal to a fully-grown Kamael like you. <br>
Also seek <font color="LEVEL">Vice Hierarch Perwan</font> in the Cave of Souls. He needs someone to eradicate the Crimson Spiders who have infested Mimir's Forest, and I think you might be ready for such an important task. <br>
Finally, receive a quest from <font color="LEVEL">Trader Erinu</font> in town. He is collecting materials for making accessories, but the materials he needs can only be found in the Nornil's Cave. Everyone says that it is too dangerous for a novice to go, so Erinu has been searching for an experienced warrior. <br>
