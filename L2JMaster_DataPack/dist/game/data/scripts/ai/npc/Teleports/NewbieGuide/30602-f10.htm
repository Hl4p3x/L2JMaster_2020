By my fang and fist, you've made progress all right! But so far your head is as empty as a year-old skull bone -- from now on, you'll need to think and plan if you want to survive. In particular, I want you to think about your equipment and skills. I want you to ask me questions now, and remember the answers -- this is very important stuff. And when you reach level 11, I'll have more information for you.<br>
