Have you heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font>? Travel north from town for a little while, then head west until you see a tower. Created by the Elves and called the Obelisk of Victory, it's considered a good place to hunt for anyone past level 7. For someone of your level, focus on battling Orcs, Orc Warriors and Werewolves. <br>
But be careful when fighting <font color="LEVEL">Orc Warriors</font>. Unlike the other monsters you've faced so far, they are aggressive and will attack you on sight!<br>
Once you pass level 10, head south to the magic school or north to the Obelisk of Victory and try your skill against Werewolf Hunters, Chieftains or Stone Golems. <a action="bypass -h Quest NewbieGuide 30598-m14.htm"><br>
