If you speak with <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Master Trudy</font>, they will show you the list of skills and magic you are eligible learn.<br>
There are two kinds of skills: active and passive. An <font color="LEVEL">active skill</font> is something you can use yourself. A <font color="LEVEL">passive skill</font> can't be directly used, but once learned it raises your basic ability level. As a Dark Fighter, you can learn several skills that raise your ability level.<br>
At level 5, you can learn your first active attack skills. The 3 available skills will be: <font color="LEVEL">Power Strike, Mortal Blow and Power Shot.</font> Power Strike can only be used when you are equipped with a <font color="LEVEL">Sword</font> class weapon, Mortal Blow can only be used when you are equipped with a <font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> class weapon, and Power Shot can only be used when you are equipped with a <font color="LEVEL">Bow</font>. Remember that! Also keep in mind that Power Shot causes a lot of damage but consumes a lot of MP, so be careful how you use it.<br>
If you have enough SP, you should strongly consider learning <font color="LEVEL">Defense Aura</font>, which raises your P. Def. and is very useful early in your career when your equipment is weak.<br>
