<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You can go into combat with the weapons you have acquired through quests. But once you reach level 15, you may find that you need more attack power. At that point, you can trade weapons with other people.<br>
You can trade items, too. It is more beneficial to trade with people than go to a shop, since it allows you to potentially get a better deal.<br>
I'll give you more information about trading. On the bottom left of the Chat window, click on the <font color="LEVEL">Trade</font> tab. You may find the window full of messages from many other adventurers seeking to buy and sell items. If possible, try to chat with those people and buy some items. Even if you are a Kamael who only cares about hunting and combat, it is useful to know how to trade.<br>
Using the <font color="LEVEL">Private Store</font> in the Action tab is a convenient way to sell items. In a Private Store, you have two options: Buy and Sell.<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Sell</font> option, execute the Sell action, then select the item you wish to sell. Set its price and enter a message, then press Start. The item is sold automatically. Quite a convenient function, eh?<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Buy</font> option, execute the Buy action, then select the item you wish to buy. Set its price and quantity, and then press Start. If no one has the item you're looking to buy, you will not be able to purchase it at that time. Dwarves can list 5 items for Purchase at a time, while the other races can list 4.<br>
