It requires serious preparation to be an effective part of a group. Experience is the best teacher, but I can tell you some of the basics.<br>
For now, your occupation or gender matters little; the most important thing is to <font color="LEVEL">find people you can trust and work well with</font>.<br>
When you look at your party in the compass/<font color="LEVEL">radar</font>, on the top right of the screen, notice that your party members are marked by <font color="LEVEL">green dots</font>. On the left side of your screen, you can <font color="LEVEL">double-click the Party window to move towards a nearby member</font>. Also on the left side of your screen, you may <font color="LEVEL">double-click on one of your party members to automatically follow them</font>.<br>
Remember too that a monster usually concentrates its attacks on the person who is most seriously injured. A monster will also generally attack whoever attacked it first. Therefore, if you are in a party with another Fighter, try to <font color="LEVEL">alternate your attacks so that the monster divides its attacks between the two of you instead of concentrating on only one.</font> Doing so will help reduce the injuries you receive while increasing your combat effectiveness.<br>
