As a Dark Fighter, you may elect to become either a <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knight</font> or an <font color="LEVEL">Assassin</font>. Regardless of which occupation you select, you must depart these woods for the Human region of Gludio.<br>
I advise you to speak to Tetrarch Thifiell for further information. He will examine your qualifications and advise you about your advancement in occupation. Go to the Shilen Temple, where you go to learn your skills, and seek out <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thilfiell</font> for counsel.<br>
