To refine your profession, you must leave Talking Island for <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>, the port city of Aden. As a Fighter, the time has come for you to face the dangers of the wide world. If you want to know more about the transition, you must visit the Fighters Guild and speak to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Bitz.</font><br>
How do you get to Gludin, you ask?  There are two modes of transportation to choose from. If you wish to take the scenic route, then you'll want to purchase a boat ticket. Just go see old Firon down at the docks and he will set you up with passage. <font color="LEVEL">But if you are looking to go fast and free, simply talk to the gatekeeper.</font> In recent years it has been ordained that anyone level 40 and under can travel via the gatekeepers free of charge, as long as you haven't completed your 2nd class transfer yet. Great news, huh!?<br>
But if you really wish to travel by ship, you should leave the village through the south gate and follow the seashore to the southeast. When you get to the wharf, buy a boat ticket from Wharf Manager Firon.  Once the boat docks, just get on. But take heed - if you don't have a ticket, you'll be kicked off the boat once it departs.<br>
The boat leaves every thirty minutes. There will be an announcement made before the ship leaves.<br>
