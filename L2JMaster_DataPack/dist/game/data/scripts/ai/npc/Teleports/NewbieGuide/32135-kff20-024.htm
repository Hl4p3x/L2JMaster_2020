Dwarven craftsmen are said to be able to crystallize anything into Leaguam, Ravi, Ciel or Arch through a process known as the "Crystallization Ritual." These Craftsmen have assigned <font color="LEVEL">grades</font> to every material in the world based on the types of crystal they form during this ritual.<br>
I am quite sure that the items you now use cannot be crystallized -- they are, as the Dwarves would say, "no grade." However, Sabers and Assassin Knives, which may be acquired beginning at level 20, are valued at D-Grade.<br>
The grades range up to A-Grade, and I've heard some of the most famous Artisans speak of an "S-grade" which surpasses all others. To determine the grade of an item in your inventory, simply click on it in the Inventory window, and an icon next to the item's name will tell you the grade.<br>
Remember, however, that a graded item will not necessarily enhance your performance. You will need to train yourself to use this item. At your level, you will find it difficult to handle even a D-Grade item. <font color="LEVEL">Once you reach level 20, you should be able to handle D-Grade items without penalty.</font> If you try to use an item at a lower level, you will not gain all the abilities it is capable of, and your speed or your hit rate will usually suffer dramatically as well. <br>
