There are two kinds of skills: active and passive. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills</font> can be used directly on the target. <font color="LEVEL">Passive skills</font>, on the other hand, permanently increase your basic abilities. If you are a Kamael soldier, you can use some skills to raise your abilities. <br>
If you are at level 5, you'd better learn active offensive skills first. You can learn two types of active offensive attacks: <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Attack and Fallen Arrow</font>. You can only use Fallen Attack when you are equipped with weapons like <font color="LEVEL">a Dagger or a Blunt</font>. Fallen Arrow is useful when you wield a <font color="LEVEL">Bow</font>. <br>
Unlike the other races, a Kamael's active offensive skill consumes the <font color="LEVEL">soul</font>. You can get it by killing enemies, but you should have the passive skill <font color="LEVEL">Soul Mastery</font> in order to accumulate it. If you don't have enough soul, you can't use any active skill which requires soul.<br>
If you have trained hard, you may have enough SP. Then find and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Master Nerga</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Master Tenor</font>. They will show you the list of skills and magics that you can learn.<br>
