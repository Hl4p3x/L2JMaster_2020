You can hunt almost everywhere on the Island at your level. Your main targets should probably be a Grotto Golem or a Shady Muertos. You can find monsters in Nornil's Cave, in the northeastern part of the town. <br>
If you crave a more difficult challenge, go to the southwest of the cave where you will find the <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Garden</font>. It is the center of the Island...and an extremely dangerous place. If you are in a party, you may attempt to penetrate it. <br>
