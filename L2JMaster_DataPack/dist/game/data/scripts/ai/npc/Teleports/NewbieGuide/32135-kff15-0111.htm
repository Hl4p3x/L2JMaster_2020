Very well. Travelling alone is not always easy, but it has its own rewards. But if you really want to live and hunt alone, you should know a few things first.<br>
Timing is important for hunting. To progress at the best rate, you must reduce the time between battles to a minimum. Defeating a powerful enemy for a single great experience reward is often less valuable than defeating a whole series of lesser enemies in the same span of time.

If you have a good supply of potions, they will also come in handy for reducing the gaps between rests, but remember to hold a few in reserve in case of a really drastic situation. <br>
