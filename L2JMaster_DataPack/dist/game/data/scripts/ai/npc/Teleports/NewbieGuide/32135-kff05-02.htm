Unless someone provides you with something better, you will likely start with the basic weapon and armor commonly distributed to beginners.<br>
You can upgrade your weapons and armor by defeating monsters and taking theirs. If you hole some trumps, you can also obtain items like a pair of <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap</font>. <br>
You initially received two types of sword: a Dagger and a Squire's Sword. A <font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> is quick but has a low accuracy; a <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword</font> is slower but more accurate. You can also use different skills depending on the type of weapon wielded.  <br>
Train hard and return to me when you have reached <font color="LEVEL">level 6</font>. Then I will teach you more about weaponry. <br>
