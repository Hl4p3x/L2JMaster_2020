Let me tell you a little about using your skills.<br>
If you strike a strong blow while a monster is casting magic, there is a good chance that it will cancel the monster's magic; using Power Strike or Mortal Blow will give you an even greater chance of cancelling the magic. But near the blessed Elven Forest, there are no monsters that use magic other than the weak Plague Zombie, so you don't have to worry about such things there!<br>
There is also an <font color="LEVEL">Over-hit</font> chance for Power Strike or Power Shot. Over-hit occurs when delivering the final strike and allows you to gain additional experience at that moment. Naturally, you gain more experience as you deliver stronger attacks, and <font color="LEVEL">if you use one of those 2 skills when a monster's HP is close to 0,</font> you can gain even more experience.<br>
When you reach level 15, be sure to learn <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Heal</font>, which is an extremely useful magic skill.<a action="bypass -h Quest NewbieGuide 30599-f15.htm"><br>
