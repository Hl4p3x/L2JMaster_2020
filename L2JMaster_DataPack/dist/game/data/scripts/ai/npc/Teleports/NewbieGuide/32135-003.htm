<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It is my task to lead the other Kamael here. However, the current of the times is now leading even other races to this place.<br>
Unfortunately, I lack the experience and perspective to provide other races with advice. I am currently contacting each of their embassies, however, so perhaps I will one day learn enough to be able to render advice to the outsiders as well.<br>
Until then, however, I recommend you return to the land of your birth if you need advice. Alternately, you can also ask for help from other adventurers.
