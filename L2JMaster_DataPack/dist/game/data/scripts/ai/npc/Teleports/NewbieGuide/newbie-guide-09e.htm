Time for another mission!<br>
If you haven't already done so, now is the time to trade your Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon for a Non-Grade Shadow Weapon. Then go help <font color="LEVEL">Gray Pillar Member Filaur</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Elders' Council House</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task he gives you, come see me for your next mission.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
