<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You seem confused about where to go next.<br>
I and my fellow Newbie Guides can help you.<br>
In addition to giving you helpful tips, we will also assign you several missions to help you gain experience, acquire equipment and receive rewards.<br>
You will be interested to know that the Adventurers' Guild has opened its warehouses to help equip newbie adventurers with magical weapons and armor. Once you reach level 6, you are eligible to receive an <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon</font>, which you can use to <font color="LEVEL">borrow a Non-Grade Shadow Weapon</font>. Shadow Items are only temporary, but while they last they will dramatically improve your combat effectiveness.<br>
