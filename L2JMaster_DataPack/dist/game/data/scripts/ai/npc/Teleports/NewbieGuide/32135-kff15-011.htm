Usually, when several people hunt together, they form a <font color="LEVEL">party</font>. You can join a party by using <font color="LEVEL">Invite</font> at <font color="LEVEL">Action</font> Tab(<font color="LEVEL">ALT + C</font>) in "Character Info." First, click on the person you wish to invite into your party, then click the Invite icon. Perhaps you should simply join a party to understand how it works.<br>
If you have any difficulty with a party, you can click <font color="LEVEL">Party Matching</font> at Action Tab in Character Info. You may also use Invite, Whisper or other useful commands from this window.<br>
You should decide whether you want to travel alone or together with others. If you feel comfortable going it alone, think about how you will support yourself. If you prefer community life, think how you could lead a party.<br>
