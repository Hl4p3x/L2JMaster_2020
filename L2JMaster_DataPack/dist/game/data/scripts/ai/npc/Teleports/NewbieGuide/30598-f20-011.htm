As a Human Fighter, you can choose <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Human Knight</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Rogue</font> as your next profession. Whichever you choose, you'll have to leave this island and go to Aden for further training.<br>
You should speak to the Grand Master for more information. He'll examine your qualifications and advise you about your next step. Go to the Warriors Guild, where you learned your skills, and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Bitz</font> for further instruction.<br><
