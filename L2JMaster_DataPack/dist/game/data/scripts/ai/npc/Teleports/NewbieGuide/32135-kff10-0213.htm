A <font color="LEVEL">Two-Handed Sword or Two-Handed Blunt Weapon</font> possesses both formidable power and reach compared to their one-handed counterparts. That power comes at the price of quickness, however.<br>
These weapons are a good choice for those who rely on inflicting devastating damage in combat. But if you wish to purchase them, you'd better raise your level and save your money! Of course, the differences specified between the One-Handed Sword and the One-Handed Blunt Weapon apply to the two-handed versions as well.<br>
