You are well on your way to becoming a mighty adventurer!<br>
Now go help <font color="LEVEL">Collector Gouph</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Bronze Key Guild</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task he gives you, come see me for your final mission.<br>
