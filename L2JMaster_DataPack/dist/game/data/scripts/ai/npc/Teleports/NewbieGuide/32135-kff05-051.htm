I will give you whatever information I know for certain. However, I don't know everyone who needs help. You'd better go to town and talk to the inhabitants yourself.<br>
First, visit the Hierarch's House and meet <font color="LEVEL">Vice Hierarch Zenya</font>. She has something of importance to say to novice adventurers, so you'd best listen to her.<br>
Also talk to <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font>, who commands the <font color="LEVEL">Marksmen</font>. I know that he is looking for a warrior for the upcoming season's re-supplying day.<br>
I'll let you know one more thing. If you have time, meet <font color="LEVEL">Marksman Bixon</font>. I have heard that he is also looking for someone to help him. <br>
