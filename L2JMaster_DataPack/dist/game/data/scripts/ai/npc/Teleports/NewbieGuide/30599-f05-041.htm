If you are a sensible Elf, you must have already realized that whenever you hunt a monster, you acquire <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> with Exp. "SP" stands for Skill Points, and from now on when you learn a skill or magic power, you will consume these points. You can check your remaining SP points by pressing <font color="LEVEL">character information</font> and looking at the <font color="LEVEL">status</font> tab in the pop-up window.<br>
