[Dark Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
A Dark Fighter who has reached level 20 may change their class to a Palus Knight or an Assassin. A character may undertake the class transfer quest at level 18; if successful, they will be able to use more specialized and powerful skills than before. In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Palace Knight</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font>, and in order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Assassin</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font>. They can both be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. Think carefully about which class you want to select, then seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
