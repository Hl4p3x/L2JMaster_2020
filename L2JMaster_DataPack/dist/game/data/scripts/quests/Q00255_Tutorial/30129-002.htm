You have learned the basic operations of the game well. From here on out, you will be able to really enjoy the adventure!<br>
Take this gift -- I presume you have already heard instructions about how to use it?<br>
You now have a choice to make. <font color="LEVEL">You can either start your adventure here in the Dark Elven Village or go to the Kamael Village.
