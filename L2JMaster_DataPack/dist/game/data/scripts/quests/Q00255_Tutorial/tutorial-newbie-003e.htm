You will receive <font color="LEVEL">beginner benefits</font> from now until you reach level 25. The benefits are as follows:<br>
1. Equipment Trade:<br1>
Used weapons and armor can be traded for better equipment, though the difference in value must be covered with additional Adena. Talk to the armor shop merchants for details.<br><br>
2. Supplemental Magic:<br1>
Ask the beginner's guide to cast supplemental magic, which helps a great deal in combat. You can receive supplemental magic from level 6 up to level 75.<br><br>
3. Additional Soulshot and Spiritshot supplies:<br1>
You will receive an additional reward upon completion of specific quests. Meet <font color="LEVEL">Chief Filaur</font> in the Dwarven Village Chief Hall and he'll speak to you about the Utuku Orcs and Chrysolite Ore. Do all he asks and he'll reward you with the <font color="LEVEL">Beginner Soulshots or Spiritshots</font> as an additional reward.<br>
