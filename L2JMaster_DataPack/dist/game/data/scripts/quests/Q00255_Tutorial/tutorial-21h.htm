[Dark Mystic Class Transfer]:<br>
A Dark Mystic who has reached level 20 may change their class to a Dark Wizard or a Shillien Oracle. A character may undertake the class transfer quest at level 18; if successful, they will be able to use more specialized and powerful skills than before. In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Wizard</font>, you must first meet the <font color="LEVEL">Witch Varika</font>, and in order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Oracle</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font>. The Witch Varika can be found <font color="LEVEL">near the Altar of Rites</font> in the Dark Elf Village, and Magister Sidra can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. Think carefully about which class you want to select, then seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
