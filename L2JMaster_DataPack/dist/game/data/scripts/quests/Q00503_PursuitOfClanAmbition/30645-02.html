I have already given it to Athebaldt. Antharas is preparing to awaken The Land Dragon. Many people dismiss it as mere rumor, but according to Athebaldt's report, it's starting, and starting soon. At that time, the wyrms and drakes inhabiting Death Pass shall follow Antharas, like soldiers being led onto the battlefield, and they will lay waste to this region.<br>
In order for Giran to survive, we must prepare. We can't suppress him, and using normal methods to fight Antharas is pointless. We must find a way to stand against Antharas's monsters. We have come up with a plan... Thankfully, Athebaldt must have heard somehow, and he chose to support us.<br>
