Well, our time together has finally come to an end. I pray that one day your clan will become strong enough to establish peace on this continent, but fear that it will take a great many deaths before peace can be established here.<br>
Now I bestow upon your clan the Seal of Aspiration. Since the days of King Rauhel this honor has been given to Aden's most promising young lords who dare to dream great dreams. Present this seal to High Priests and Grand Masters and you'll receive help in strengthening your clan.
