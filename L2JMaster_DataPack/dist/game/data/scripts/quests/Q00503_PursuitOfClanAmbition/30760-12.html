<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
History shows us again and again that ultimate power, complete domination comes most often to those with the superior technology. It's because of that that I have long supported the Black Anvil guild. Their mission is to research the ancient technology of the giants, technology which has so far failed to yield any practical applications even when it has such amazing potential.<br>
There is a Dwarf in the guild named <font color="LEVEL">Balthazar</font> in whom I have invested much time and resources. He is an amazing Artisan, and I believe that his efforts will soon bear fruit. However, he has reached an impasse in his work and has requested my help. It has something to do with a new type of golem he is developing.... He will tell you more when you see him. Take this letter and find him in <font color="LEVEL">Hunters Village</font>.
