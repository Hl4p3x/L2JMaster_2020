Excellent! You have brought all Spiteful Soul Energies I asked for. Shall I take a look? Join me, my friend! Ah...I can feel the power of the souls thrumming like the string of a lyre! If we can tap this source, we will be able to develop an almost unlimited source of energy! Then my name will be sung forever in the halls of my descendants!
