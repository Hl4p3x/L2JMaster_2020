<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
The power of the royals has been eroding for years now. Just look at the peasants' uprising in Dion a few years ago; past generations wouldn't have dared dream of such things, and yet... here we are. The uprising planted seeds, see, and now a number of groups are preparing to claim power from the throne.<br>
Our kingdom needs young, energetic lords like you to lead it into the future, but you're not yet ready yet.<br>
Once your clan distinguishes itself further, I will join forces with you and lend you my support, even if you already have more than enough allies.<br>
(Only a level 4 clan leader can undertake this quest.)
