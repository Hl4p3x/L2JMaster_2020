<html><body>Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
I've heard about your clan... you are the Clan in high spirits, no? I heard that you were headed towards Death Pass...? I'll be counting on you. Please find my brother. He received the title of honorable Bounty Hunter... These days he hangs out with a bad crowd called the <font color="LEVEL">Magpie's Brothers</font>. People say they were hired by a human aristocrat to find something in Death Pass... There is something very fishy about them....
