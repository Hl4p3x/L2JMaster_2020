From what Sir Athebaldt has told me, your clan has decided to aid my research. Is that true? Excellent! Oh, you want to know some details about my studies? Of course; I will gladly tell you, my friend. My old friend Tajif Goldgather recently found some mysterious documents in the Cruma Tower. To make a long story short, we are researching a potential energy source. If we are successful, we will be able to maximize the efficiency of a number of devices.<br>
