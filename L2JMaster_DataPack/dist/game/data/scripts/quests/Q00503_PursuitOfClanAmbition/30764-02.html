From what Sir Athebaldt has told me, your clan has decided to aid my research. Is that true? Excellent! Oh, you want to know some details about my studies? Of course; I will gladly tell you, my friend. I am working with my old friend Tajif Goldgather to find a new energy source. If we are successful, we will be able to maximize the efficiency of a number of devices. Exciting, isn't it?<br>
