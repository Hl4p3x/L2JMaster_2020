Ah! I need more Spiteful Soul energy to complete my research. Go to the Massacre Fields. There you will find the Spiteful Soul Captain, who possesses the energies of several vengeful spirits. It will not be easy to defeat him because he surrounds himself with followers, but I think your party is powerful enough to do so. Defeat the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Spiteful Soul Captain</font> and obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Spiteful Soul Energy</font> before the souls disappear. If they are destroyed, they are worthless to me... Bring me at least <font color="LEVEL">10</font> and I will be exceedingly grateful.
