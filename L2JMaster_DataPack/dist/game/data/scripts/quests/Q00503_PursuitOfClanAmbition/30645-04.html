The land dragon will soon be awake. This will decide the fate of Giran... no, the entire kingdom itself. Hurry to <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font>, and obtain <font color="LEVEL">Sandworm Eggs, Drake Eggs, Blitz Wyrm Eggs, and Mist Drake Eggs</font>. One or two won't do 0 I need <font color="LEVEL">10 of each</font>. I know it will be difficult, but please do this for me.<br>
Oh! One more thing - the Blitz Wyrm and the Mist Drake are quite rare, so you will have more difficulty finding them. And if you run into the dwarves who were dispatched earlier, you may receive some clues. Good luck.
