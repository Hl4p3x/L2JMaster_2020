<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
You must find the <font color="LEVEL">Scepter of Judgment</font> and secure it before it falls into the wrong hands. Go and see <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>. Give him the letter I gave you and he will tell you what to do next.
