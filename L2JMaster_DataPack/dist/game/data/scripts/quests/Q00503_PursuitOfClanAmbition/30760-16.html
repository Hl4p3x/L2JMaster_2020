<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
Much has transpired since then. Dire warnings of global destruction and chaos are rife throughout the land. A force has been dispatched to deal with Antharas, and evil spirits are wreaking havoc in several parts of the kingdom. Warlords are battling against each other for the privilege of ruling the territories. We haven't much time; we must quickly finish our preparations.<br>
Have you heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Scepter of Judgment</font>? Legend states that whoever holds it becomes invincible in battle. Of course this is complete nonsense, but the problem is that everyone believes it to be true, commoner and soldier alike....<br>
Take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>. He and his family are all my faithful servants. He will tell you what you are to do when you see him.
