<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
I see from your face that Sir Rodemai has been talking about me....<br>
Please don't misunderstand my intentions; When King Rauhel was alive, I served him faithfully, and I have been as truthful with you as I thought I could be, but I believe my country needs a strong ruler such as myself....<br>
Ah yes, the mighty Scepter of Judgment! Ha! Even if it has no genuine powers, the reputation it has garnered and the fear it instills in others almost makes it as powerful as the legend. Now with the scepter by my side I can rally my troops and make our enemies tremble! I will become invincible!<br>
And what of you? I must admit, I took advantage of your clan, but didn't you also use me for your own purposes? You will certainly need my help in the future. There may come a day when we will face each other as enemies, but for now, what is it that you need the most?<br>
Perhaps the very thing I have in my hand? The <font color="LEVEL">Seal of Aspiration</font>?<br>
We can each help ourselves by helping each other! A fair trade, no?<br>
