We are collecting the eggs of wyrms and drakes in order to learn about their breeding habits. One expert in this field is thinking of studying these eggs at the suggestion of numerous pet managers. In order to collect the eggs, several dwarven bounty hunters were dispatched to <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font>, but it has been over a week since their departure, and they have not yet returned. Perhaps it was too much for them? I would like for you to go to Death Pass and collect the eggs. Please obtain 10 each of the <font color="LEVEL">Sandworm Eggs, Drake Eggs, Blitz Wyrm Eggs, and Mist Drake Eggs</font>. The Blitz Wyrms and Mist Drakes are very rare, so you may have difficulty finding them. Also, if you run into the dwarves who were dispatched earlier, you may receive some clues. Good luck!
