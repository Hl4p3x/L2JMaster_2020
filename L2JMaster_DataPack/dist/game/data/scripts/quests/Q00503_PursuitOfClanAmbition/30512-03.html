They don't respect their ancestors. They are bounty hunters who dig up graves and rummage through relics to collect anything that's valuable. They were named the Magpie's Brothers because of their greed. They even hoarded relics from the Dwarf Kingdom found in the ancient labyrinth in Schuttgart and sold them to collectors at high prices! They have no shame! The Magpie's Brothers were eventually banished from the Dwarf Kingdom, and rumor has it that they since sneaked into the Kingdom of Aden and have been stealing relics from the Elmore-Aden national cemetery... Recently, I heard that they are working on collecting eggs in Death Pass, and are cooperating with some human aristocrat....
