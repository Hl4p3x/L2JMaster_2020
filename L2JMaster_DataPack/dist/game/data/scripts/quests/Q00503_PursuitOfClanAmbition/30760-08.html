Right now, Giran is very unhapppy because of the Land Dragon Antharas. It's understandable because rumor has it Antharas is awake again. The ones in power in Giran, the nobles and merchants, are discussing ridiculous solutions about hiring mercenaries and such. The fools.... You know, a swarm of drakes and wyrms may emerge from Death Pass soon, so I can't just wait 'til those useless nobles come up with a half-baked solution.<br>
I'm starting a business in Giran to find a solution; here's something you might interested in. First, go to <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font>, and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font>. He's taking care of business me. He's someone I trust, so cooperate with him. May god bless you and your clan.
