You must be truly skilled to defeat the Guardians of Relics... I'm impressed! Now go inside the Seal of the Saintess and find your way to Solina's casket room. Use the central teleport device. To see the Holy Treasure of Solina, you will have to battle the Last Guardians, the protectors of Solina's tomb. This is the final test before the you discover the answers you seek. Everything you've done comes down to this. Good luck...<br>
