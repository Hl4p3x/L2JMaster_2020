Ah, at last... We finally meet. I have waited for you for a very long time. You are foretold in Einhasad's prophecy, did you know that? I'm grateful for you, I imagine your journey here must have been difficult. I too am tired. My soul longs for peace, but I cannot be at peace until I speak to you that which will save the world.<br>
