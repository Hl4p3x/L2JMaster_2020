<html><body>Tomb of Saintess:<br>
You look at the tomb, and see these words.<br>
"For the Saintess Solina, who devoted all her life to serve Einhasad and the Elmoreden Kingdom...to be remembered forever by those she saved and those who loved her...may punishing find the feet of those who ignored Solina's teachings."<br>
This is not Solina's real tomb.
