You don't remember how to be a Scavenger? If you want to be a Scavenger, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the Scavenger test. If you want to take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi in the Dwarven Village</font>. Pass her test and she'll give you a proof. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Scavenger right away.
