You're getting ahead of yourself! You haven't achieved level 20 and you haven't taken the Scavenger test!<br>
Now, listen carefully! There's only one way to become a Scavenger. Raise your level and pass the Scavenger test. To take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi in the Dwarven Village</font>. Pass her test and she'll give you a proof. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Scavenger right away.
