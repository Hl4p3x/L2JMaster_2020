You don't know the path to becoming a Scavenger? First, you must be at least at level 20.<br>
That won't change even if you pass the test to become a Scavenger. It is my belief that until you reach level 20 or higher, you still lack the basic qualities necessary to transfer to the Scavenger class. I see that you are very close to accomplishing that goal. After you upgrade your level by hunting monsters, no one will question your qualifications, adventurer. Return here after upgrading your level, and I will certainly recognize you as a Scavenger.
