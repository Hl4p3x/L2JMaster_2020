If you want to be a Scavenger, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
To take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi in the Dwarven Village</font>. Pass her test and she'll give you a proof. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Scavenger right away.<br>
