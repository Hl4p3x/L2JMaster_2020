<font color="LEVEL">Scavengers</font> collect the ingredients which are essential for making items. They must be ready to go anywhere in the world to get necessary materials and they occasionally even search dead bodies for items. Scavengers don't just collect things. They must possess the strength and fighting skills necessary to cope with dangerous situations. Elite Scavengers may become <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Hunters</font>. Bounty Hunters collect Dragon Scales and can be selected to lead Trade Associations once others recognize their abilities.<br>
Artisans are not my area of expertise, but I'll tell you the basics. Artisans create items with the materials that Scavengers or Bounty Hunters bring in. Artisans are physically weaker than Scavengers, but their creativity is superb.<br>
