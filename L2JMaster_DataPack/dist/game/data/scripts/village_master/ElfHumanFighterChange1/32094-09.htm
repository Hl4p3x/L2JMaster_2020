<font color="LEVEL">Rogues</font> are the most practical of all Human Fighters. They avoid the dangers of close combat by using long-distance weapons, such as Bows and Small Swords. They're well-known for their agile and unusual combat style.<br>
Their specialties include scouting, investigating, espionage and assassination. The most elite Rogues become either a <font color="LEVEL">Hawkeye</font> specializing in Bows or a <font color="LEVEL">Treasure Hunter</font> specializing in Daggers.<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Rogue must pass the appropriate test and bring me <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique's Recommendation</font> as proof.<br>
