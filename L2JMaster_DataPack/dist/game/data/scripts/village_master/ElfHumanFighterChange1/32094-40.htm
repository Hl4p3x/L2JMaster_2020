In order to change your profession, you must reach at least level 20. That holds true for becoming a Elven Scout as well: you must be level 20 or higher, and you must pass the Test of the Elven Scout.<br>
Although your level meets the requirements, you have yet to pass the test. Seek out <font color="LEVEL">Reisa in the Town of Gludio</font> to take the test. If you pass, return here with Reisa's <font color="LEVEL">Recommendation</font> as proof of your fitness to become an Elven Scout.
