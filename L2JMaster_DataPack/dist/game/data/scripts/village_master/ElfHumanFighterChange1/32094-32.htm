<html><body>Grand Master Schule:<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Rogue must have achieved at least level 20 and brought me <font color="LEVEL">Bezique's Recommendation</font>.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique in Gludin Village</font>. Pass the test and bring me his Letter of Recommendation as evidence. Only then will I transfer you to the Rogue class.
