<font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique in Gludin Village</font> will give you his Letter of Recommendation when you pass the test for Rogue class transfer. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Rogue.<br>
You can find Captain Bezique on duty at the east entrance of Gludin Village near the port. Remember, the Gatekeeper can make a long trip much shorter and less complicated.<br>
