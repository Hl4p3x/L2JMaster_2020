<font color="LEVEL">Knights</font> fight very differently from Warriors, whose sword skills are based on a philosophy of attack. Knights, on the other hand, use a defense-oriented style well-suited for close-distance combat. Their role is to protect other members of their party by using their defensive skills to lure monsters away.<br>
As a result of their willingness to sacrifice themselves for others, Knights are honored and respected throughout the land. If you win your spurs as a Knight, you may one day even aspire to the top ranks of the Knightly class, the <font color="LEVEL">Paladin</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Dark Avenger</font>.<br>
But first you must become a Knight by passing the Test of the Knight and returning with the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Ritual</font> as proof.<br>
