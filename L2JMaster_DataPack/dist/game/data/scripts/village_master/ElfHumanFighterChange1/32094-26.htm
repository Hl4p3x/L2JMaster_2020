Anyone wishing to become a Human Knight must have achieved at least level 20 and brought me the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Ritual</font> as proof of having passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've accomplished neither one! Achieve at least level 20 and then speak with <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font> about taking the test. You'll most likely find him around the Warrior Guild in Gludin Village. He places the utmost importance on courtesy, so be on your good behavior!
