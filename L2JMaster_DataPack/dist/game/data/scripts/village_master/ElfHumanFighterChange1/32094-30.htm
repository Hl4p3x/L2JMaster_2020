Anyone wishing to become a Rogue must have achieved at least level 20 and brought me <font color="LEVEL">Bezique's Recommendation</font> as proof of having passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've accomplished neither one! Achieve at least level 20 and then speak with <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique in Gludin Village</font>. Pass his test and bring me his Letter of Recommendation. Only then will I transfer you to the Rogue class.
