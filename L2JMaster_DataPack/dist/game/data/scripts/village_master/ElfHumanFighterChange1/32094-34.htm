<html><body>Grand Master Schule:<br>
Anyone wishing to become an Elven Knight must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've accomplished neither one! Achieve at least level 20, and then speak with <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius in Gludin Village</font>. You'll find him in the Warrior Guild. Pass his test and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight Brooch</font> as proof. Only then will I promote you to Elven Knight.
