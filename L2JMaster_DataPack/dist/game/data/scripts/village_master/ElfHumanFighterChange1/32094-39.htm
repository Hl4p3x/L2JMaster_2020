<html><body>Grand Master Schule:<br>
Congratulations! You have now become an Elven Scout. Though your new occupation may seem unfamiliar, if you diligently learn skills from nearby masters, you will become a cunning Elven Scout.<br>
I pray that you will become a shining example of Eva's protection. Wherever you go, never forget the honor and integrity of your vows.<br>
This is a small gift we have prepared to help you on your journey. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
