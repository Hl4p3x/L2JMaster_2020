The class of <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight</font> is achieved by Elven warriors who have chosen swordsmanship as their specialty. Quick and agile, Elven Knights dominate their enemies with graceful swordsmanship and nimble footwork -- watching them, you'll think that you're watching the most magnificent warriors in the world. Originally the Elven Knights were established as an Order of Knights to defend the Mother Tree from invaders. Now, however, many of them have ventured into the Human world to advance the will of Einhasad and Eva.<br>
The most talented among the Elven Knights can advance to become <font color="LEVEL">Temple Knights</font>, who focus purely on swordsmanship or <font color="LEVEL">Swordsingers</font>, whose mystic songs raise the morale and fighting power of their comrades in battle. Naturally, achieving such lofty positions requires not only natural talent but also years of rigorous training.<br>
To become an Elven Knight, you must first pass a test and bring back proof called the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight's Brooch</font>.<br>
