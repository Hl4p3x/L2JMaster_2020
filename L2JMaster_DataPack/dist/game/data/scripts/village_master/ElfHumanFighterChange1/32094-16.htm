<font color="LEVEL">Elven Scouts</font> are different from ordinary Knights in that they prefer the bow to the sword. As a result, their fighting power is generally lower. But they have shown their toughness by successfully defending the Elven Forest for thousands of years. For this reason, some people call them the Watchmen of the Forest.<br>
Among Elven Scouts, who value agility above all else, the most talented ones are often selected to become renowned adventurers called <font color="LEVEL">Plains Walkers</font>. Also, a number of Elven Scouts are chosen to become <font color="LEVEL">Silver Rangers</font>, who train to acquire ultimate mastery in archery. Of course, achieving such prestigious positions requires exceptional focus and years of rigorous training.<br>
In order to become an Elven Scout, you must pass a test and bring back proof called "Master Reisa's Recommendation."<br>
