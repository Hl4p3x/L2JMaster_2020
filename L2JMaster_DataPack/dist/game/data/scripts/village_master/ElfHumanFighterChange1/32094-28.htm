<html><body>Grand Master Schule:<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Human Knight must have achieved at least level 20 and brought me the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Ritual</font>.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the appropriate test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font> of the Human Knight Guild. You should find him at the Warrior Guild in Gludin Village. Mind you, he's a stickler for proper etiquette, so be very polite!
