<font color="LEVEL">Clerics</font> are Wizards who consider the source of energy enveloping the world to be sacred, and they perform miracles by using its power. Their magic mainly consists of White and Beneficial Magic, always used to help others. Clerics are altruistic for the most part, but they're completely capable of defending themselves when attacked.<br>
Clerics value sacrifice above all else, and their healing abilities are excellent. They are welcomed and respected wherever they go. Clerics who've been extremely diligent with their training based on their spirit of sacrifice may become <font color="LEVEL">Bishops</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Prophets</font>.<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must possess a strong sense of sacrifice and faith, and bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font> as proof.<br>
