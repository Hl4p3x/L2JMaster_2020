Of course, the Wizard is no exception. Anyone wishing to become a Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is adequate, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> about taking the test. Collect proof of all 4 elements and she'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Wizard!
