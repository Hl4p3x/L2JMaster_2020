Of course, the Elven Wizard is no exception. Anyone wishing to become an Elven Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've done neither one! Reach level 20 and then speak with <font color="LEVEL">Rosella in Elven Village</font> about taking the test. Pass her test and I'll make you an Elven Wizard!
