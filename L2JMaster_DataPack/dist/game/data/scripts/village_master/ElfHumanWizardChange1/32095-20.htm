Congratulations! You have advanced one level as a child of the goddess. Advancing in life may bring both joy and sorrow. But the holy light of Einhasad will shine upon your path and bless your steps.<br>
Here is a small gift to help you on your journey. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
