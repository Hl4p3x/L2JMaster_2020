Anyone wishing to become an Elven Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Rosella in Elven Village</font> if you want to take the test. Pass her test and she'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">Eternity Diamond</font>. Bring it to me and I'll make you an Elven Wizard.
