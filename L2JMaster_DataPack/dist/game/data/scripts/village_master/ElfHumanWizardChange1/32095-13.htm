<html><body>High Priest Marie:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oracles</font> utilize light, life and Spirits of Purification derived from Eva and Einhasad. These Priests advise their Elven compatriots through their close interaction with spirits. They use White and Beneficial Magic, and their spirit of sacrifice is similar to that of the Clerics. Their Speed and Casting Speed, however, are superior to the Clerics.<br>
The most spiritual of the Oracles are chosen to be <font color="LEVEL">Elders</font>. They develop White Magic to its highest level and are considered to be the most-blessed by Einhasad and Eva.<br>
Anyone wishing to become an Oracle must bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font>. Once  you've done this, I'll make you an Oracle!<br>
