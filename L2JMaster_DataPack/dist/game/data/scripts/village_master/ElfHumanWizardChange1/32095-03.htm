<font color="LEVEL">Wizards</font> not only study the fundamental energy that forms the world, they also divide that energy by its characteristics and amplify and assemble it for practical use. They use Elemental, Dark and Summoning Magic, focusing mainly on magic attacks, thus their White and Beneficial Magic abilities are weaker. But their ability to summon Servitors gives them a great advantage on the battlefield.<br>
Some Wizards study at the Ivory Tower in Oren in order to advance to a higher occupation such as <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerer, Warlock or Necromancer</font>. Unfortunately, there aren't many of these chosen these days...<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Wizard must bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>.<br>
