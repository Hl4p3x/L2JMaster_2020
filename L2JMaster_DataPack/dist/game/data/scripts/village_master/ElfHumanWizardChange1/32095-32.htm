<html><body>High Priest Marie:<br>
Congratulations! You have been reborn as Eva's priest. As the goddess' priest, your road ahead may be filled with danger. But you will walk that path with Einhasad's blessing and Eva's protection. Congratulations again!<br>
Here is a small gift to help you on your journey. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
