Of course, the Oracle is no exception. Anyone wishing to become an Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is adequate, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel</font> at the Temple in the northern part of the Town of Gludio. Pass his test and he'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font>.
