Of course, the Wizard is no exception. Anyone wishing to become a Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've done neither one! Reach level 20 and then speak with <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> who you can find studying the elements at the <font color="LEVEL">Temple in Gludin Village</font>. Collect proof of all 4 elements and you'll get the <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Wizard!
