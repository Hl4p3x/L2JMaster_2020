Congratulations! You have now become a proud Dark Elf Bladedancer. Life as a Bladedancer may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious -- you can learn what you need to know one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
May you dedicate yourself to swordplay and never stray from Shilen's service. Congratulations once again!<br>
