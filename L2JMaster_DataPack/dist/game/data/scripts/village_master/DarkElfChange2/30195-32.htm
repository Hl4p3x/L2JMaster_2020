Congratulations! You have now become a proud Dark Elven Shilien Knight. Life as a Shilien Knight may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious -- you can learn what you need to know one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
As a glorious Shilien Knight who strikes in the name of Shilen, I hope you will become a mighty warrior and crush those arrogant Elves! Congratulations once again!<br>
