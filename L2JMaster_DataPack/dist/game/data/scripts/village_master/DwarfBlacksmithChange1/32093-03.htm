Anyone wishing to become an Artisan must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br><font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Silvery in the Dwarven Village</font> knows better than anyone else what you need to do to become an Artisan. I doubt you'll pass the test, but if you do, come back to see me! I'll make you an Artisan, no problem!<br>
By the way, Gatekeepers make long journeys much shorter and less complicated. You could get to the Dwarven Village in no time!<br>
