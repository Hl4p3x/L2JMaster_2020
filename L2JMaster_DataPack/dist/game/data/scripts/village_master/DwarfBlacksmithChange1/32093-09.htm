Not everyone who wants to become an Artisan can become one... Your level isn't 20 yet and you haven't even applied to take the test! I don't have time to waste on the likes of you! Get out!<br>
Oh, what a sad look! All right, I'll tell you again... To be an Artisan, you must raise your level and pass the appropriate test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Silvery in the Dwarven Village</font>. Come back to see me after you pass the test and I'll make you an Artisan! Understood?
