<html><body>Head Blacksmith Bolin:<br>
Hmmph, you've finally become an artisan. Though you're not yet reliable, you're still a member of our Black Anvil Guild and responsible for upholding the honor and integrity of the guild. From here on out, my advice is that you focus on becoming the best artisan you can be. I'm telling you this a little late, but make sure you're diligent about learning skills from nearby blacksmiths.<br>
Here's a small gift for you from our guild. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you can exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
