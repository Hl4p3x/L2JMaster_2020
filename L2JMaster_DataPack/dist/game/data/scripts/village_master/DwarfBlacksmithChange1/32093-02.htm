<font color="LEVEL">Artisans</font> specialize in making items with materials brought to them by Scavengers and Bounty Hunters.<br>
Artisans lack the physical strength and fighting ability of Scavengers, but their creativity is exemplary. They are very sought-after during wartime, and they survive battle well since they send Siege Golems to the front line to do their fighting for them.<br>

Scavengers are not my specialty, but I'll tell you what I know about them. They collect all sorts of materials for the manufacture of items.<br>
Scavengers must be ready to travel anywhere in the world at a moment's notice to obtain necessary materials, and sometimes even scavenge dead bodies for items.<br>
The most elite Scavengers become <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Hunters</font>.<br>
