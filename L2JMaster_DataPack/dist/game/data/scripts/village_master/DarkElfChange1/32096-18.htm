Anyone wishing to become a Palus Knight must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You have not met these requirements. Speak with color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font> of the Dark Elf Guild in the northeastern part of the Town of Gludio.  Pass his test, and receive the <font color="LEVEL">Gaze of Abyss</font> as reward.  Bring this item to me, and I shall promote you to Palus Knight.
