Anyone wishing to become a Palus Knight must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the test to become a Palus Knight. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font> in the Town of Gludio, pass his test, and accept the <font color="LEVEL">Gaze of Abyss</font> as reward. Bring it to me and I'll transfer you to the Palus Knight class.
