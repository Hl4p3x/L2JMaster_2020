<html><body>Grand Master Helminter:<br>
No Warrior of a lesser race can hope to match the blade skill of the <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knight</font>! These elite Knights blend nimble attacks with inpenetrable defense.<br>
The most elite of the Palus Knights can become <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Knights</font>, invoking the Magic of Darkness and Water, or <font color="LEVEL">Bladedancers</font>, refining their  swordsmanship even further.<br>
Anyone wishing to advance to this class must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by fetching for me the <font color="LEVEL">Gaze of Abyss</font>.<br>
