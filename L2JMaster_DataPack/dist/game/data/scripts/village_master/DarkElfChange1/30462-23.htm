<html><body>Grand Master Tronix:<br>
Congratulations! You have now become a deadly Dark Elf Assassin. Life as an Assassin may still be unfamiliar, but by learning skills one by one from nearby masters, I know that you will become worthy of our trust.<br>
In the name of Shilen, I pray that you may be a devoted servant of our dark goddess and a terror to our enemies.<br>
This is a small gift we have prepared to help you on your journey. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
