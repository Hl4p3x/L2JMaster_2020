Anyone wishing to become a Shillien Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You have not met the requirements. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font> at the Dark Elf Guild in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font> to take the test, and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss</font> as proof.
