Anyone wishing to become an Assassin must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> of the Dark Elf Guild in the Town of Gludio, pass his test, and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Heart</font> as proof.
