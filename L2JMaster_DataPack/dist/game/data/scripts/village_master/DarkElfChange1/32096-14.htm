If you wish to take the test to become a Shillien Oracle, you should speak with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font> of the Dark Elf Guild in <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Gludio</font>. Pass her test and bring me the proof, the <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss</font>, and I'll grant your transfer. You'll find the Dark Elf Guild in the northeastern part of Gludio.<br>
