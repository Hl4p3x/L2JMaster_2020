Anyone wishing to become an Assassin must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You have not met the requirements. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> at the Dark Elf Guild in the northeastern part of the Town of Gludio to take the test. Bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Heart</font> that he gives you.
