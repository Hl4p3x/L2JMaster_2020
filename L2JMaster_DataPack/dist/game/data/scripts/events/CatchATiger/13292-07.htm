We're not sure. All we know is that, when we use this new experimental summoning scroll, creatures appear, we think from another dimension.<br>
The White Tigers are particularly interesting for our research, and we're rewarding anyone who can subdue them long enough for us to take a look.<br>
It's not a difficult task, provided you've got the spine to stare down a White Tiger. Brrr... those eyes.<br><br><br>
